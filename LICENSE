 1. Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't be a dick.

     Being a dick includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:

	 1a. Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy the original work/works and change the name.  
	 1b. Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being a dick.  
	 1c. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER dick.  

 2. If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work,
 share the love. Only a dick would make loads off this work and not buy the original work's 
 creator(s) a pint.
 
 3. Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching when it goes wrong makes 
 you a DONKEY dick. Fix the problem yourself. A non-dick would submit the fix back or submit a [bug report](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html).

 4. If you use code, calling it your own would make you a ROYAL dick. [How to cite a repo](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/14010/how-do-you-cite-a-github-repository). Alternatively, even just a comment giving attribution to where you found the code would be OK.
